# ROS Obstacle Avoidance

This project goal was to program a TurtleBot so that it could navigate in a non-previously known environement.
The challenge was divided into a first simulation part using gazebo and a second part on a real circuit with three different types of obstacles:

- In the first part, the robot should use only its camera to follow the line and get trough the roundabout :

- The second part is obstacle avoidance and the robot should use both LIDAR and line detection

- The last part is a corridor that should be crossed using only LIDAR
